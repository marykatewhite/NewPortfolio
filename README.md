#Portfolio: Mary Kate White

A mobile-first responsive portfolio to display some of my past projects (which I will update and improve soon). Contains a brief description of my background and what I am currently learning at U of R, as well as links to my email, LinkedIn, GitHub and a PDF of my resume. I find all of this quite embarrassing.
